## 🔭 Introduction
<p align="center">
<strong>TL;DR: OSMLoc is an image-to-OpenstreetMap (I2O) visual localization framework with geometric and semantic guidance.</strong>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> OpenStreetMap (OSM), a rich and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), facilitates human self-localization and scene understanding by integrating nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, the disparity in modalities and perspectives poses a major challenge for effectively matching camera imagery with compact map representations, thereby limiting the full potential of VGI data in real-world localization applications. Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on the fusion of geometric and semantic understanding for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired visual localization approach based on first-person-view images against the OSM maps. It integrates semantic and geometric guidance to significantly improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

## 🚅 Usage

### MGL dataset 
Please download the MGL dataset [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dsP_Wl_m9MpLHimp8qch0A?pwd=22gj)(passwd: 22gj)(>120G). As the MGL dataset is extremely large, please reserve enough space.
After extraction, the file structure  should be as follows
```
datasets
│
├── MGL
│   ├── avigon
|          ├── images info
|                 ├── 000001.json

``` 

### CC Benchmark
You could download the CC benchmark [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yUI8SY-RWsz30LKMFkgseA?pwd=26ms)(passwd: 26ms). The file structure is the same as in MGL dataset.

### KITTI dataset

Download and prepare the dataset to `/datasets/kitti/`:

```
python -m maploc.data.kitti.prepare
```

### Evaluation
For the MGL dataset, CC benchmark and KITTI dataset, we provide pre-trained models on [googledrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/142HxByjjPwY9Cbwyj6kEiut_sHxs9GSD?usp=sharing) and [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CPOasGzZaCv95ppYyZgj_g?pwd=bu7b) (passwd:bu7b).
Please download the weights of OSMLoc from webdrive and put them in a folder like ```checkpoints```.

Example 1: evaluate ```OSMLOC``` on the MGL dataset

```
python -m maploc.evaluation.mapillary --checkpoint="./checkpoints/osmloc_small.ckpt" --dataset=mgl model.num_rotations=256 model.image_encoder.val=True
```
Above operation calculates the per-frame localization error, and the evaluation results on the MGL dataset should be close to:
```
PR@1m=14.04, PR@3m=44.00, PR@5m=57.31;
OR@1m=21.84, OR@3m=53.38, OR@5m=68.41;
```

Example 2: evaluate ```OSMLOC``` on the munich part of CC benchmark

```
python -m maploc.evaluation.mapillary --checkpoint="./checkpoints/osmloc_small.ckpt" --dataset=munich model.num_rotations=256 model.image_encoder.val=True
```
Above operation calculates the per-frame localization error, and the evaluation results on the MGL dataset should be close to:
```
PR@1m=3.20, PR@3m=19.53, PR@5m=38.27;
OR@1m=15.07, OR@3m=39.19, OR@5m=55.94;
```

Example 3: evaluate ```OSMLOC``` on the KITTI dataset

```
python -m maploc.evaluation.kitti kitti model.num_rotations=256  model.image_encoder.val=True
```
Above operation calculates the per-frame localization error, and the evaluation results on the MGL dataset should be close to:
```
LatR@1m=65.75, LatR@3m=93.79, Lat@5m=96.74;
LonR@1m=24.50, LonR@3m=59.53, LonR@5m=72.67;
OR@1m=37.43, OR@3m=79.69, OR@5m=91.67;
```

Example 4: evaluate ```OSMLOC``` on the MGL dataset with sequential frames

```
python -m maploc.evaluation.mapillary --checkpoint="./checkpoints/osmloc_small.ckpt" --dataset=mgl model.num_rotations=256  model.image_encoder.val=True --sequential --particle
```
The above operation employs the Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) framework with a simulated motion model to estimate per-frame localization, and the evaluation on the MGL dataset is expected to yield results close to:
```
PR@1m=23.86, PR@3m=61.58, PR@5m=75.72;
OR@1m=27.47, OR@3m=61.48, OR@5m=75.40;
```


### Training
Example: train ```OSMLoc``` on the MGL dataset
```
python -m maploc.train experiment.name=osmloc
```
